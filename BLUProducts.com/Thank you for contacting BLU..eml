Hello,

Please re-read our original email fully! You still have not changed the
"C5L 2020" folder since 2022, and the FTP has not been updated since 2023
of October as of Feb 23, 2024. The source was not uploaded properly, the
wrong folder was uploaded to the FTP.

We hope you have a good day,
Unofficial GNU GPL Legal Team! <unofficial.gnu.gpl.legal.team@gmail.com>
