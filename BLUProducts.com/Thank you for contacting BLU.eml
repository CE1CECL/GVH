Hi there again,
there seems to be a u-boot on my phone and it's also a GNU license, do you
provide buildable sources? The kernel source in FTP doesn't seem to be a
kernel, in fact, looks to be ripped off the android build source's wrong
folder. I did see at least 2 devices that you do provide buildable sources
for, that are mostly if not complete android AOSP build system. If you can,
send me build instructions, open source toolchains if used, and let me know
what was proprietary and removed from source if as needed, so I can fully
build this thing. Just remember not to remove too much, as that as far as I
know is a violation of GNU, but might not be to others like Apache.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks!
Christopher Lentocha
